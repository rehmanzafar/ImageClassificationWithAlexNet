# ImageClassificationWithAlexNet

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful machine learning technique from the field of deep learning. CNNs are trained using large collections of diverse images. From these large collections, CNNs can learn rich feature representations for a wide range of images. 

In this project, images from [Caltech 101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) are classified into categories using a pretrained AlexNet model.
